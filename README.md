### React JS based Starlink Trajectory Visualization 
* Designed a visualization dashboard using React and D3 to track satellites in real-time based on geo-locations (e.g. longitude, latitude and timestamp)
* Animated selected satellite paths on a world map using D3 to improve the user friendliness
* Deployed the dashboard to Amazon Web Service for demonstration
